# ðŸ§  Diabetics Dataset â€“ Predictive Modeling & Patient Segmentation

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview  
This project focuses on building an intelligent system that leverages both **classification** and **clustering** techniques to analyze diabetic patient data. The system aims to predict diabetes outcomes and uncover hidden patterns to support better healthcare decisions.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Apply **Random Forest Classification** to predict whether a patient is likely to have diabetes.  
- Use **K-means Clustering** to group patients based on health indicators and discover meaningful segments.  
- Combine supervised and unsupervised learning to enhance data understanding and decision-making.  
- Identify key features influencing diabetes outcomes and patterns across patient subgroups.  

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- K-means Clustering  

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results  
- Achieved accurate diabetes prediction using Random Forest, with key features like Glucose, BMI, and Age.  
- Identified distinct patient clusters showing varying risk profiles and health patterns.  
- Demonstrated the value of combining classification and clustering in healthcare analytics.
